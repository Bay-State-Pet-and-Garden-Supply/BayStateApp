# Product Guidelines: Bay State Pet & Garden Supply

## 1. Tone and Voice
**Primary Tone: Expert & Neighborly**
- **Philosophy:** Content should sound like a knowledgeable neighbor giving advice over the fence—warm, accessible, but authoritative.
- **Application:**
    - Avoid overly corporate jargon. Use conversational but professional language.
    - Product descriptions should highlight practical benefits (e.g., "Keeps your barn dry" vs. "High-grade moisture barrier").
    - Error messages should be helpful and forgiving, not technical.

## 2. Visual Aesthetic & Design Language
**Primary Goal: Functional Utility meets Modern Cleanliness**
- **Hierarchy:** Functionality comes first (Option B), followed immediately by modern aesthetics (Option A).
- **Key Principles:**
    - **Functional Utility:** High-contrast buttons, clear typography, and a focus on readability in diverse environments (e.g., bright sun, dim barns).
    - **Modern Cleanliness:** Generous whitespace, high-quality product imagery, and structured Bento-grid layouts to declutter the shopping experience.
    - **Palette:** Use a foundation of clean neutrals (white/gray) for structure, accented by high-visibility colors for actions and subtle brand colors for identity.

## 3. Mobile-First Experience
**Mandate: "Barn-Ready" Usability**
- **Touch Targets:** All interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links) must meet a minimum size of **44px x 44px** to accommodate "working hands."
- **Content Hierarchy:** Critical decision-making data (Price, "In Stock" status, "Add to Cart") must be visible **above the fold** on mobile devices.
- **Navigation:** Implement a persistent **Sticky Cart** and bottom navigation bar to ensure checkout and search are always one tap away.

## 4. Product & Service Integration
**Strategy: Contextual Integration**
- **Unified Discovery:** Services (e.g., Propane Refill) and products coexist in search results but are visually distinguished by "Action Callouts" (e.g., "Reserve" vs. "Add to Cart").
- **Service Injection:**
    - **Logic:** Do not sequester services. Inject service cards directly into relevant product grids.
    - **Example:** In the "Grilling" category, a "Propane Refill" service card should appear naturally (e.g., as the 4th item) alongside grills and charcoal, reminding users of the service at the moment of intent.
